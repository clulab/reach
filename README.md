Reach
=====

# What is it?

Reach stands for **Re**ading and **A**ssembling **C**ontextual and **H**olistic Mechanisms from Text. In plain English, Reach is an information extraction system for the biomedical domain, which aims to read scientific literature and extract cancer signaling pathways. Reach implements a fairly complete extraction pipeline, including: recognition of biochemical entities (proteins, chemicals, etc.), grounding them to known knowledge bases such as Uniprot, extraction of BioPAX-like interactions, e.g., phosphorylation, complex assembly, positive/negative regulations, and coreference resolution, for both entities and interactions.

Reach is developed using [Odin](https://github.com/clulab/processors/wiki/ODIN-(Open-Domain-INformer)), our open-domain information extraction framework, which is released within our [`processors`](https://github.com/clulab/processors) repository.

# Installation

This software requires Java 8 or 11 and Scala 2.11 or 2.12.

The `jar` is available on Maven Central. To use, simply add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.clulab</groupId>
   <artifactId>reach-main_2.12</artifactId>
   <version>1.6.2</version>
</dependency>
```

 The equivalent SBT dependencies are:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
    "org.clulab" %% "reach-main" % "1.6.2"
)
```

# How to compile the source code

This is a standard sbt project, so use the usual commands (i.e., `sbt compile`, `sbt assembly`, etc.) to compile.
Add the generated jar files under `target/` to your `$CLASSPATH`, along with the other necessary dependency jars. Take a look at `build.sbt` to see which dependencies are necessary at runtime.

# Running Reach

## Processing a directory of `.nxml` papers

The most common use of Reach is to process a directory containing one or more papers in the proper formats. A Wiki page documents the [supported input formats](https://github.com/clulab/reach/wiki/Supported-Input-Formats).

Some configuration is necessary before running Reach. Please refer to the [Running Reach](https://github.com/clulab/reach/wiki/Running-Reach) Wiki page for detailed information on configuring and running Reach.

## Pre-processing a directory of `.nxml` papers

Reach supports pre-processing documents and storing intermediate results, containing lemmatization, POS tags, NER tags and dependency parses as serialized files. This allows for use cases where new rules are iteratively developed without having to spend computational resources more than once on parsing and tagging the nxml diles. See [pre-processing input formats](https://github.com/clulab/reach/wiki/Supported-Input-Formats#pre-processing) for the details.

## The Interactive Shell

An interactive shell can be run from the command line to process small fragments of entered text. The shell is useful for reviewing and understanding the operation of Reach, including NER, entity, and event processing and rule debugging. To start a Reach shell, run the [runReachShell.sh](https://github.com/clulab/reach/blob/master/runReachShell.sh) script:

```
runReachShell.sh
```

At the shell prompt enter `:help` to get a list of available commands.

## The sieve-based assembly system
Reach now provides a sieve-based system for assembly of event mentions.  While still under development, the system currently has support for (1) exact deduplication for both entity and event mentions, (2) unification of mentions through coreference resolution, and (3) the reporting of intra and inter-sentence causal precedence relations (ex. A causally precedes B) using linguistic features, and (4) a feature-based classifier for causal precedence.  Future versions will include additional sieves for causal precedence and improved approximate deduplication.

For more details on the sieve-based assembly system, please refer to the following paper:

```
@inproceedings{GHP+:2016aa,
  author       = {Gus Hahn-Powell and
Dane Bell and
Marco A. Valenzuela-Esc\'{a}rcega and Mihai Surdeanu},
  title        = {This before That: Causal Precedence in the Biomedical Domain},
  booktitle    = {Proceedings of the 2016 Workshop on Biomedical Natural Language Processing},
  organization = {Association for Computational Linguistics}
  year         = {2016}
  Note         = {Paper available at \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08089}}
}
```

The sieve-based assembly system can be run over a directory of `.nxml` and/or `.csv` files:
 ```scala
 sbt "runMain org.clulab.reach.RunReachCLI"
 ```

In `src/main/resources/application.conf`, you will need to...

1. set `outputTypes` to `["assembly-tsv"]`
2. set your input directory of papers via `papersDir`
3. set your output directory via `outDir`

Currently, two `.tsv` files are produced for assembly results **within** each paper:

1. results meeting [MITRE's (March 2016) requirements](https://github.com/clulab/reach/blob/3d4f82c87f1b4c7299ff2ceae8adc352212bd430/src/main/scala/org/clulab/assembly/AssemblyExporter.scala#L337-L352)
2. results without MITRE's constraints

Two additional output files are produced for assembly results **across** all papers:

1. results meeting [MITRE's (March 2016) requirements](https://github.com/clulab/reach/blob/3d4f82c87f1b4c7299ff2ceae8adc352212bd430/src/main/scala/org/clulab/assembly/AssemblyExporter.scala#L337-L352)
2. results without MITRE's constraints

### The interactive Assembly shell

You can run interactively explore assembly output for various snippets of text using the assembly shell:

```scala
sbt "runMain org.clulab.assembly.AssemblyShell"
```

# Modifying the code
Reach builds upon our Odin event extraction framework. If you want to modify event and entity grammars, please refer to [Odin's Wiki](https://github.com/sistanlp/processors/wiki/ODIN-(Open-Domain-INformer)) page for details. Please read the included Odin manual for details on the rule language and the Odin API.

# Reach web services

We have developed a series of web services on top of the Reach library. All are freely available [here](http://agathon.sista.arizona.edu:8080/odinweb/).

# Reach datasets

We have generated multiple datasets by reading publications from the [open-access PubMed subset](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/) using Reach. All datasets are freely available [here](https://github.com/clulab/reach/wiki/Datasets).

# Funding

The development of Reach was funded by the [DARPA Big Mechanism program](http://www.darpa.mil/program/big-mechanism) under ARO contract W911NF-14-1-0395.
