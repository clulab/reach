      <abstract>
        <p>Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are widely used in regenerative medicine in light of their ability to differentiate along the chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages. As a type of traditional Chinese medicine, quercetin has been preliminarily reported to promote osteogenic differentiation in osteoblasts. In the present study, the effects of quercetin on the proliferation, viability, cellular morphology, osteogenic differentiation and angiogenic factor secretion of rat BMSCs (rBMSCs) were examined by MTT assay, fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis, real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) analysis, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and calcium deposition assays, and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Moreover, whether mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways were involved in these processes was also explored. The results showed that quercetin significantly enhanced the cell proliferation, osteogenic differentiation and angiogenic factor secretion of rBMSCs in a dose-dependent manner, with a concentration of 2 &#x3BC;M achieving the greatest stimulatory effect. Moreover, the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK) and p38 pathways was observed in quercetin-treated rBMSCs. Furthermore, these induction effects could be repressed by either the ERK inhibitor PD98059 or the p38 inhibitor SB202190, respectively. These data indicated that quercetin could promote the proliferation, osteogenic differentiation and angiogenic factor secretion of rBMSCs in vitro, partially through the ERK and p38 signaling pathways.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are important members of the stem cells family [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. MSCs are ideal stem cells for tissue regeneration due to their excellent capacities for proliferation and differentiation. After being induced in vitro or in vivo, MSCs can be differentiated into several types of tussues such as fat, muscle, bone, cartilage, tendon, ligament, nerve and liver tissue [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129605.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As a type of MSCs, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are widely used in studies of bone regeneration due to their properties of multipotency and active proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129605.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. More importantly, using appropriate methods, BMSCs can also be induced to secrete angiogenic factors, and these factors can then effect on resident vascular endothelial cells to promote blood vessel formation in vivo. The regeneration of bone defects specifically consists of a series of complex processes that are regulated by a variety of cytokines and biological signals. In a bone defect, angiogenesis occurs earlier than osteogenesis; since bone regeneration cannot successfully occur without a blood supply reaching the bone defect, angiogenesis is important for bone regeneration in vivo [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is reported that angiogenesis is the foundational step in bone regeneration, specifically in calvarial and limb bone defects [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It is shown that angiogenesis occurs before osteogenesis in the healing of bone defects. In particular, angiogenesis provides the blood supply, which benefits the subsequent progression of osteogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A previous study in a rabbit calvarial defect model further revealed that there was intimate spatial and temporal correlation between newly formed blood vessels and extra skeletal bone formation [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In these two processes, angiogenesis occurs before osteogenesis in bone healing; then, both angiogenesis and osteogenesis participate in the bone regeneration and promote the effects of each other [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As shown in previous studies, many approaches have been applied to stimulate angiogenesis in the process of bone healing, including the combination with endothelial cells, the application of vascular growth factors, vascular remodeling by microsurgery and gene transfection techniques [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, the most ideal induction method would simultaneously promote the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and enhance the expression of angiogenic factors.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, Chinese medicine, which could promote the secretion of osteogenic factors such as collagen type 1 (COL1), bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), osteocalcin (OCN) and osteopontin (OPN), and the gene expression of BMP-4, runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), OCN and OPN, has been increasingly applied in osteogenic induction research [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Quercetin is a type of bioflavonoid; bioflavonoids comprise numerous natural compounds, such as catechin, quercetin and rutin, among others. Quercetin is abundant in Ginkgo biloba extracts and in the flowers and leaves of many plants and fruits [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. As a traditional Chinese medicine, quercetin has been extensively studied due to its potential pharmacological properties and beneficial health effects [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129605.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and it was firstly used as a Chinese medicine for the treatment of scurvy and heart disease [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129605.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Recent studies have reported that quercetin could enhance the osteogenic differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) and osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells and inhibit osteoclastogenesis in RAW 264.7 cells [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Moreover, it has been reported that quercetin could stimulate Osterix (Osx), Runx2, BMP-2, OPN, OCN, COL1 and ALP gene expression in ASCs [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129605.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and increase bone sialoprotein (BSP) and OCN gene expression in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Based on these previous studies, the present study intended to evaluate the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs as well as the expression of angiogenic factors by these cells in response to treatment with the traditional Chinese medicine quercetin.</p>
      <p>It is well known that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways are involved in cell survival, proliferation and differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129605.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and comprise the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK), p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways. A previous study has demonstrated that these three signaling pathways are specifically involved in the osteogenic differentiation of stem cells [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It has also been shown that the ERK signaling pathway can stimulate the osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and that the JNK and p38 signaling pathways can promote the synthesis of extracellular matrix and calcium salt deposits. Previous studies have additionally shown that the ERK signaling pathway is involved in the drug effects of quercetin on MG-63 human osteoblasts and human ASCs [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129605.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, it remains to be evaluated whether ERK activation is achieved through the effects of quercetin, which include cell proliferation, osteogenic differentiation and angiogenic factor expression, on BMSCs. Moreover, it should be confirmed whether the other two signaling pathways (p38 and JNK) are also involved in these processes.</p>
      <p>In the present study, our hypothesis is that quercetin can induce the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs as well as the expression of angiogenic factors in a dose-dependent manner and that these effects may be related to MAPK signaling pathways. To assess our hypothesis, quercetin was applied to rBMSCs at different concentrations, and the effects of quercetin on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs as well as the expression of angiogenic factors, were systematically investigated. Moreover, the mechanisms involved, including the ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways, were explored.</p>

        <p>In the present study, rBMSCs were isolated from 4-week-old male SD rats weighing 50 &#xB1; 5 g. A total of 20 rats were used for the in vitro research in the present study. The rats were sacrificed using an overdose of chloral hydrate, and then both ends of the femurs were cut off at the metaphyses. The marrow was flushed out with 10 mL Dulbecco&#x2019;s modified Eagle&#x2019;s medium (DMEM; Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, USA) and antibiotics (penicillin 100 U/mL, streptomycin 100 U/mL) using a 22-gauge needle [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The primary cells were then cultured in an incubator at 37&#xB0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 4 days and the medium was renewed every 2 days. When 90% confluence was reached, the rBMSCs were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and passaged using 0.25% trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (trypsin/EDTA). In the present study, the cells from passages 1 to 3 were used for subsequent experiments.</p>

        <p>Quercetin (C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, CAS No.: 117-39-5, Sigma, USA) was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma, USA) to obtain a 20 mM stock solution, which was then diluted in the medium to desired concentrations. The MTT assay was used to test the effect of quercetin on cell proliferation. Briefly, the cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5&#xD7;10<sup>3</sup> cells/well and cultured in DMEM (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, USA) and antibiotics (penicillin 100 U/mL, streptomycin 100 U/mL). After being cultured for 24 hours, the cells were treated with quercetin at different concentrations (0, 1, 2, 5 and 10 &#x3BC;M) and cultured for 12 hours, 1, 4 and 7 days, respectively. At each time point, the cells were washed twice with PBS, and then 200 &#x3BC;L DMEM supplemented with 20 &#x3BC;L 5 mg/mL MTT (Amresco, USA) solution was added and incubated at 37&#xB0;C for 4 hours. Subsequently, the medium was replaced with 200 &#x3BC;L DMSO and vibrated for 10 min to dissolve the MTT formazan crystals. Finally, the absorbance was measured at 490 nm using an ELx Ultra Microplate Reader (BioTek, USA). Meanwhile, a standard curve for the MTT assay was generated; the cells were seeded in 96-well plates at different densities of 5&#xD7;10<sup>3</sup>, 1&#xD7;10<sup>4</sup>, 1.5&#xD7;10<sup>4</sup>, 2&#xD7;10<sup>4</sup> and 2.5&#xD7;10<sup>4</sup> cells/well and cultured in the DMEM medium, respectively, after which the cell number was quantified according to a cell standard curve [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>BMSCs have been widely used for bone regeneration for a long time [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Sources of BMSCs are widespread, and these cells are easy to obtain and can undergo multipotential differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Thus, BMSCs are one of the most commonly used types of seed cells for bone tissue engineering. Under certain conditions, BMSCs can differentiate into osteogenic cells and stably express an osteoblastic phenotype; moreover, their osteogenic activities can continue after implantation [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Due to the limited availability of human MSC tissue sources, rat MSCs were chosen in the present study; however, the use of these cells limits the clinical relevance of the results, which means the findings should be validated by using human primary MSCs in our future work on quercetin.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, using a specific certain induction method, BMSCs could secrete angiogenic factors, which facilitate the function of angiogenesis. It is well known that angiogenesis is important for subsequent bone regeneration in vivo. Previous studies have shown that the survival of seed cells in vivo relies on the blood supplying of oxygen and nutrients and that a lack of oxygen and nutrition can cause the rapid necrosis or apoptosis of cells within 3 days [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify an ideal induction method to promote the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and the secretion of angiogenic factors by these cells.</p>
      <p>As a traditional Chinese medicine, quercetin is commonly used to treat scurvy and heart disease [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129605.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Moreover, recent studies have shown that quercetin can promote osteogenic differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. According to previous studies, quercetin could obviously promote the osteogenic differentiation of human ASCs at a concentration of 2 &#x3BC;M, whereas a concentration of 5 &#x3BC;M was optimal for osteoblast-like cells [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129605.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These findings indicate that the optimal quercetin concentration may be cell type dependent. Therefore, based on previous studies, the concentrations of 1, 2, 5 and 10 &#x3BC;M were selected in the present study. Analysis of the in vitro results suggested that quercetin could enhance the osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs as well as the expression of angiogenic factors in a dose-dependent manner and that a concentration of 2 &#x3BC;M could achieve the greatest stimulatory effect.</p>
      <p>Previous studies showed that quercetin could stimulate the osteogenic differentiation of ASCs and osteoblastic cells but that there was no positive effect on cell proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In the present study, the effect of quercetin on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs was comprehensively studied. In contrast to previous studies, our results indicated that quercetin could enhance the proliferation of rBMSCs at days 1, 4 and 7 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas a concentration of 2 &#x3BC;M could achieve the greatest effect; furthermore, quercetin did not affect cell viability or cellular morphology. Following quercetin treatment, ALP activity and calcium deposition assays and osteogenic gene expression analysis were performed. ALP, an early marker of osteogenic differentiation, is positively correlated with cell differentiation and maturation [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129605.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], whereas calcium deposition is a later marker of osteogenic differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. It is well known that Runx2 and COL1 are considered as early markers of osteogenic differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], whereas BSP, BMP-2 and OCN are middle and late markers [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. OPN appears during early proliferation and later differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129605.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. It has been reported that Runx2 is involved in the regulation of gene expression during the process of osteogenic differentiation, which plays an important role in the maturation and stabilization of osteoblasts [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. COL1 provides a basic framework for mineralized inorganic material deposition and plays a decisive role in the biomechanical strength properties of bone tissue [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. BSP plays a key role in the initiation processes of bone matrix mineralization and mineralized cell adhesion matrix formation [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Moreover, BMP-2 can promote the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and can also inhibit the differentiation of BMSCs into other cell types, such as adipose and skeletal muscle cells [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129605.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. As a bone matrix component, OCN is one of the main indicators of the phase of osteoblast differentiation involving mineralization, whereas OPN is related to the phase of osteoblasts maturation between adhesion prior to mineralization and matrix synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129605.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In the present study, as an early marker of osteogenic differentiation, the expression of Runx2 in the 2 &#x3BC;M group increased at 1 hour and peaked at 3 hours; this increase in expression of Runx2 then slowed down at 6 and 12 hours. In accordance with reports indicating that Runx2 can stimulate OPN, OCN and BSP gene expression [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], OPN, OCN and BSP gene expression in the 2 &#x3BC;M group peaked at 6 and 12 hours, respectively, in the present study. Moreover, it has also been suggested that the enhanced gene expression of these osteogenic genes could consequently increase Runx2 gene expression [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In the present study, Runx2 gene expression in the 2 &#x3BC;M group was significantly different from that in the other groups at 24 hours, possibly due to the stimulatory effects of OPN, OCN and BSP. However, in the present study, quercetin could enhance ALP activity and the above osteogenic genes, especially the middle and late markers (BSP, BMP-2, OPN and OCN), in a dose-dependent manner; this stimulatory effect was most obvious at the concentration of 2 &#x3BC;M. These results indicated that quercetin could not only promote the proliferation of rBMSCs but also enhance osteogenic differentiation at various stages, especially at the middle and late stages; additionally, the concentration of 2 &#x3BC;M was found to be the optimum concentration. However, previous studies have shown that the cellular morphology is one of aspects, which can influence the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]; the other studies also showed that some transcription factors (TFs) and Chinese medicine, such as zinc fingers and homeoboxes 3 (ZHX3), Runx2 and Tinospora cordifolia, could promote the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs by regulating the gene expression and secretion of osteogenic markers without significant effect on the cellular morphology [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Present study also showed that quercetin could stimulate the osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs by promoting the gene expression and secretion of osteogenic markers without obvious effect on the cellular morphology.</p>
      <p>Most previous studies regarding quercetin have focused on osteogenic differentiation; however, the effect of quercetin on the expression of angiogenic factors was not evaluated [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129605.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The present study also analyzed the effect of quercetin on the expression of angiogenic factors by BMSCs. As a key angiogenic factor, VEGF can simultaneously promote osteogenesis and angiogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129605.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], and can specifically affect vascular endothelial cells by inducing cell proliferation, migration and angiogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129605.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. <underline>As a</underline> paracrine <underline>angiogenic factor, VEGF could also</underline> increase the permeability of small veins and venules and promote the accumulation of cytoplasmic calcium, as well as induce angiogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. A previous study also showed that VEGF could stimulate the proliferation and osteogenesis of BMSCs and indirectly promote the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts by stimulating endothelial cells to secrete osteoanabolic growth factors [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. <underline>Acting</underline> as another important angiogenic factor, ANG-1 can stimulate angiogenesis by reducing the VEGF-mediated vascular permeability to a certain extent [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Additionally, ANG-1 can promote the differentiation, bone matrix deposition and mineralization of osteoblasts [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Although previous studies showed that quercetin could inhibit the angiogenic gene expression of tumor cells [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129605.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], in the present study, the results of RT-PCR and ELISA analyses showed higher VEGF gene and protein levels in rBMSCs treated with quercetin. Moreover, the results of RT-PCR showed that quercetin could stimulate the gene expression of ANG-1. All of these data indicate that quercetin could enhance angiogenic factor expression of rBMSCs, which could in turn promote angiogenesis and osteogenesis in vivo.</p>
      <p>However, previous research has mostly focused on the secretion of angiogenic factors by undifferentiated bone marrow derived MSCs such as mesenchymal progenitor cells, marrow-derived stromal cells and multipotent stromal cells [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>&#x2013;<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]; moreover, recent studies reported that the osteogenically differentiated MSCs that cultured in osteogenic induction medium could lead cells antiangiogenic and reduce the secretion of angiogenic factors like VEGF and platelet-derived growth factor-AA (PDGF-AA) [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129605.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. However, many studies reported that some growth factors such as BMP-2 [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129605.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], BMP-9 [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], epidermal growth factor (EGF) [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>], growth and differentiation factor-5 (GDF-5) [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129605.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129605.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], could promote osteogenic differentiation of MSCs as well as secretion of angiogenic factors by inducing both osteogenic and angiogenic signaling pathways without osteogenic induction medium. In the present study, it has been firstly observed that as a kind of Chinese medicine, quercetin could not only promote osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs, but also enhance the secretion of angiogenic factors in a dose-dependent manner, while the concentration of 2 &#x3BC;M could achieve the greatest effect. Recent studies also reported that quercetin could stimulate the induction and functions of immune cells and enhance the functions of the immune system [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129605.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. However, whether quercetin can affect the immunogenic status of BMSCs has remained largely unknown. Indeed, the immunogenicity of MSCs is the one of the important topics in bone regeneration and will be assessed in our future studies.</p>
      <p>Previous studies showed that quercetin could promote the osteogenic differentiation of MG-63 human osteoblasts through the ERK signaling pathway [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129605.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]; however, it has remained largely unknown whether the p38 and JNK signaling pathways, the other two important pathways in MAPK signaling, are involved in this process. It is well known that the ERK, p38 and JNK pathways are crucial for the regulation of cell proliferation, osteoblast differentiation and skeletal development [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129605.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. In particular, the ERK signaling pathway can be activated in cells throughout the developmental phase, which can promote immediate early gene expression, reinforce matrix mineralization and promote osteogenic differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. The p38 signaling pathway plays an important role in cell growth, survival and differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. The JNK signaling pathway has been reported to potentially enhance OCN mRNA level and to be involved in BMP-2-induced osteoblastic cell differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129605.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Our present findings showed that quercetin could activate the ERK and p38 signaling pathways, resulting in higher p-ERK and p-p38 protein levels at 120 min. However, quercetin did not lead to significant activation of the JNK signaling pathway. Furthermore, to demonstrate whether the stimulatory effect of quercetin on the proliferation and differentiation of rBMSCs is dependent on the ERK and p38 signaling pathways, the specific ERK and p38 inhibitors PD98059 and SB202190 were applied to quercetin-treated rBMSCs, respectively. The results showed that pretreatment with PD98059 and SB202190 blocked quercetin-induced ERK and p38 phosphorylation, respectively. Moreover, quercetin-stimulated ALP activity and the expression of osteogenic genes (Runx2, COL1, BSP, BMP-2, OPN and OCN) and angiogenic genes (VEGF and ANG-1) could be repressed by either PD98059, or SB202190, respectively. Moreover, the inhibitor SB202190 could also inhibit phosphorylation of the ERK signaling pathway in the present study. Previous study also reported that the p38 inhibitor was found to abrogate TNF-alpha-induced ERK phosphorylation in human proximal tubular epithelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. It has been suggested that there are several points shared between the ERK and the p38 signaling pathways, leading to cross-talk between these two pathways [<xref rid="pone.0129605.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0129605.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Therefore, p38 may also regulate ERK phosphorylation in the context of the effects of quercetin, although this concept requires further evaluation in our future studies. All of these data indicated that quercetin stimulated the proliferation, osteogenic differentiation and angiogenic factor expression of rBMSCs, partially through the ERK and p38 signaling pathways.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, quercetin could promote the cell proliferation, osteogenic differentiation and angiogenic factor expression of rBMSCs in a dose-dependent manner, and a concentration of 2 &#x3BC;M quercetin achieved the greatest stimulatory effect. Furthermore, the ERK and the p38 signaling pathways might play an important role in this process. It is suggested that quercetin may represent a drug that can be potentially applied for bone regeneration.</p>
