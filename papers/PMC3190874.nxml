        <p>Elevated IgE levels and increased IgE sensitization to allergens are central features of allergic asthma. IgE binds to the high-affinity Fc&#x3F5; receptor I (Fc&#x3F5;RI) on mast cells, basophils, and dendritic cells and mediates the activation of these cells upon antigen-induced cross-linking of IgE-bound Fc&#x3F5;RI. Fc&#x3F5;RI activation proceeds through a network of signaling molecules and adaptor proteins and is negatively regulated by a number of cell surface and intracellular proteins. Therapeutic neutralization of serum IgE in moderate-to-severe allergic asthmatics reduces the frequency of asthma exacerbations through a reduction in cell surface Fc&#x3F5;RI expression that results in decreased Fc&#x3F5;RI activation, leading to improved asthma control. Our increasing understanding of IgE receptor signaling may lead to the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of asthma.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Asthma is a disease characterized by reversible airway obstruction, airway hyper-reactivity, and chronic airway inflammation that manifest as symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and wheezing. Asthma is estimated to affect up to 300 million people worldwide, and although the majority of asthmatics are well controlled by treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators, many asthmatics are still inadequately controlled by current therapies, with the most severe asthmatics responding poorly to all available medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Given that the most severe 5&#x2013;10% of asthmatics are estimated to account for nearly 50% of total healthcare costs related to asthma, there is a significant need for new therapies for the treatment of asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p>
      <p>Asthma is one of several allergic diseases that are associated with elevated IgE levels and increased IgE sensitization to allergens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). IgE binds to two different receptors, the high-affinity Fc&#x3F5; receptor I (Fc&#x3F5;RI)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2"><sup>2</sup></xref> and the low-affinity receptor Fc&#x3F5;RII/CD23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In humans, Fc&#x3F5;RI is found on mast cells and basophils, where it is a tetrameric complex consisting of one &#x3B1;-chain, one &#x3B2;-chain, and two disulfide-bonded &#x3B3;-chains, and on dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, macrophages, and eosinophils, where it is a trimeric complex consisting of one &#x3B1;-chain and two disulfide-bonded &#x3B3;-chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The Fc&#x3F5;RI &#x3B1;-subunit (Fc&#x3F5;RI&#x3B1;) is unique to Fc&#x3F5;RI, whereas the &#x3B2;- and &#x3B3;-subunits (FcR&#x3B2; and FcR&#x3B3;, respectively) form complexes with other Fc receptors and, in the case of FcR&#x3B3;, the T cell receptor, in addition to Fc&#x3F5;RI. IgE stabilizes the cell surface levels of Fc&#x3F5;RI by preventing the internalization of the receptor from the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The up-regulation of cell surface Fc&#x3F5;RI levels by IgE increases the sensitivity of cells to Fc&#x3F5;RI activation triggered by allergen-induced cross-linking of IgE that is bound to Fc&#x3F5;RI. Activation of Fc&#x3F5;RI on mast cells and basophils leads to degranulation, eicosanoid production, and cytokine production, which are associated with early- and late-phase anaphylactic reactions that can result in exacerbations of asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Activation of Fc&#x3F5;RI on dendritic cells leads to increased antigen presentation and cytokine and chemokine production, which may enhance T-helper 2 cell sensitization, which promotes the allergic inflammation that drives asthma pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). CD23 is found on B cells and myeloid cells, where it is a homotrimeric complex that regulates IgE synthesis and mediates antigen presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p>
      <p>A key role for Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma was demonstrated by the therapeutic neutralization of serum IgE in moderate and severe allergic asthmatics, including those who respond poorly to all other therapies, using a monoclonal antibody that blocks the binding of IgE to both of its receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Treatment with anti-IgE antibody results in significant anti-inflammatory effects that ultimately lead to a reduction in the frequency of asthma exacerbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Upon neutralization of serum IgE, cell surface Fc&#x3F5;RI levels are reduced on mast cells, basophils, and dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The reduction in mast cell and basophil surface Fc&#x3F5;RI levels results in decreased Fc&#x3F5;RI activation and is proposed to be the primary mechanism underlying the efficacy of anti-IgE treatment. However, anti-IgE therapy does not completely abrogate Fc&#x3F5;RI activation; has a relatively slow onset of efficacy; and, due to dosing limitations, is not approved for patients with very high IgE levels, who might benefit the most from neutralization of serum IgE. Thus, approaches that inhibit Fc&#x3F5;RI activation more directly, potently, and quickly than anti-IgE therapy are promising new therapies for the treatment of asthma. Given the important role of Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling and mast cell activation in asthma pathogenesis, this minireview focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the positive and negative regulation of Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling in mast cells. For a detailed discussion of CD23, see several excellent reviews that cover CD23 structure, signaling, and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p>

      <title>Fc&#x3F5;RI Expression, Distribution, and Dynamics at the Cell Surface</title>
      <p>The Fc&#x3F5;RI&#x3B1;, FcR&#x3B2;, and FcR&#x3B3; components of the tetrameric Fc&#x3F5;RI complex in mast cells have different functions in Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling. Fc&#x3F5;RI&#x3B1; contains an extracellular domain that binds IgE but does not directly mediate intracellular signaling. FcR&#x3B3; contains a cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) that couples Fc&#x3F5;RI cross-linking to the initiation of intracellular signaling. FcR&#x3B2; also contains an ITAM and functions as an amplifier of intracellular signals. The cell surface expression of the human Fc&#x3F5;RI complex is regulated by a number of factors. Fc&#x3F5;RI&#x3B1; contains multiple endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signals that reside in the signal peptide, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic regions of the Fc&#x3F5;RI&#x3B1; sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Additional residues in the transmembrane domain of Fc&#x3F5;RI&#x3B1; mediate interactions with FcR&#x3B3; that are required for cell surface expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In addition to its role in directly promoting Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling via its ITAM, FcR&#x3B2; also acts as a chaperone that increases cell surface Fc&#x3F5;RI expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Members of the Rab family of GTPases and their intracellular cofactors, such as Rab5, Rabex-5/RabGEF1, and Rabaptin-5, regulate cell surface levels of Fc&#x3F5;RI by modulating Fc&#x3F5;RI internalization and the cell surface stability of Fc&#x3F5;RI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p>
      <p>Cross-linking of many cell surface receptors results in receptor partitioning to detergent-insoluble membrane lipid fractions (lipid rafts) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Lipid rafts are enriched in signaling and adaptor molecules that mediate intracellular signal transduction, and the localization of cell surface receptors to lipid rafts assists the signal transduction process. For Fc&#x3F5;RI, biochemical and biophysical studies have demonstrated that cross-linking and activation are associated with redistribution of Fc&#x3F5;RI to lipid rafts, and this recruitment of Fc&#x3F5;RI to lipid rafts is important for Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). However, the overall role of lipid rafts in the initiation <italic>versus</italic> maintenance of Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling is unclear. One model of Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling postulates that activation is initiated in lipid rafts, requiring the recruitment of Fc&#x3F5;RI to lipid raft environments that contain the initiating Src family kinase Lyn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Another model of Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling postulates that activation can be initiated outside of lipid raft compartments, where a small fraction of Lyn that is pre-associated with the FcR &#x3B2;-subunit activates Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling upon receptor cross-linking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). In this model, the recruitment of Fc&#x3F5;RI to lipid rafts is important for signal propagation and maintenance through adaptor proteins such as LAT, but not initiation. Recent biophysical studies of Fc&#x3F5;RI and membrane lipid distribution and dynamics have enabled the monitoring of very small lipid raft microdomains in cells under physiologic conditions. The results of these studies suggest a hybrid of both models and indicate that lipid raft microdomains coalesce upon cross-linking of Fc&#x3F5;RI and redistribute with aggregated Fc&#x3F5;RI proteins in a time frame that correlates with the kinetics of Fc&#x3F5;RI phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p>

      <title>Signaling Events Proximal to Fc&#x3F5;RI</title>
      <p>Intracellular Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling proceeds through a network of signaling molecules and adaptor proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The Src family kinases mediate intracellular signaling events that are proximal to Fc&#x3F5;RI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Lyn is the most highly expressed Src family kinase in mast cells, and it initiates Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling by phosphorylating the ITAMs of FcR&#x3B2; and FcR&#x3B3;. However, the overall role of Lyn as a positive or negative regulator of mast cell activation downstream of Fc&#x3F5;RI is controversial. Substrates for Lyn phosphorylation include both positive regulators of Fc&#x3F5;RI signal transduction such as Syk and negative regulators of Fc&#x3F5;RI signal transduction such as Cbp (<underline>C</underline>sk-<underline>b</underline>inding <underline>p</underline>rotein), which recruits Csk, a negative regulator of Src family kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> studies of Lyn knock-out mast cells have demonstrated increased, decreased, or unaffected degranulation and increased cytokine production upon Fc&#x3F5;RI activation compared with wild-type mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). The discrepancy in effects of Lyn deficiency on mast cell degranulation in these various studies may be due to genetic differences in Fyn expression and activity that are associated with different mouse background strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). It may also be due to differences in the strength of Fc&#x3F5;RI stimulation that result in differences in the net role of Lyn as a positive or negative regulator of Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). The interpretation of <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of Lyn knock-out mice is complicated by age-dependent increases in serum IgE, total numbers of mast cells, and spontaneous mast cell activation. Young Lyn knock-out mice have a hyper-responsive degranulation phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic> compared with wild-type mice, indicating an overall negative regulatory role for Lyn in mast cell degranulation downstream of Fc&#x3F5;RI activation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Although older Lyn knock-out mice have a defective degranulation phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic>, this phenotype appears to result from a reduced ability to sensitize these mice with exogenous IgE due to high circulating levels of endogenous IgE as opposed to inherent defects in Fc&#x3F5;RI-mediated mast cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>).</p>

      </fig>
      <p>Other Src family kinases that play a role in Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling are Fyn and Hck. Both Fyn and Hck have positive regulatory roles in mast cell activation such that Fyn and Hck knock-out mast cells have reduced degranulation and cytokine production upon Fc&#x3F5;RI activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Fyn is involved in the activation of lipid signaling pathways mediated by PI3K, sphingosine kinase (SphK), and phospholipase D (PLD), which are discussed further below. Among Lyn, Fyn, and Hck, Hck negatively regulates Lyn, and Lyn negatively regulates Fyn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Lyn knock-out mast cells with enhanced Fyn activity are hyper-responsive to Fc&#x3F5;RI activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Reduction of Lyn function through disruption of Lyn localization to lipid rafts can also lead to increased Fyn activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). This may provide an explanation for the allergic phenotypes that are observed in humans with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, a disease that arises from a defective gene mutant of 3&#x3B2;-hydroxysterol &#x394;<sup>7</sup>-reductase (DHCR7), an enzyme that converts 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol. Knock-out of DHCR7 in mice results in a disruption of lipid raft stability due to low cholesterol levels and a reduction in the lipid raft localization of Fc&#x3F5;RI and Lyn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Fyn activity is increased in DHCR7 knock-out mouse mast cells, resulting in increased mast cell degranulation upon activation of Fc&#x3F5;RI.</p>
      <p>A key mediator of proximal Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling is Syk, which is recruited to the Fc&#x3F5;RI complex by association with phosphorylated FcR&#x3B3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Subsequent to its association with Fc&#x3F5;RI, Syk is phosphorylated and activated by Lyn. Syk phosphorylates the adaptor proteins LAT and NTAL/LAB/LAT2, whose functions are described below, and thereby coordinates the activation of multiple downstream signaling pathways. This ultimately leads to mast cell degranulation, eicosanoid production, and cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Structural and functional aspects of Syk activity in mast cell signaling have been reviewed extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>Adaptor Proteins in Fc&#x3F5;RI Signaling</title>
      <p>Two major adaptor proteins downstream of Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling are LAT and NTAL/LAB/LAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Phosphorylation of LAT by Syk leads to the recruitment and activation of phospholipase C&#x3B3; (PLC&#x3B3;), which is discussed further below, as well as the recruitment and activation of Ras/Rho GTPases and MAPKs (<italic>i.e.</italic> p38, JNK, and ERK), leading to mast cell degranulation, eicosanoid production, and cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). The LAT adaptor protein integrates both positive and negative regulatory signals downstream of Fc&#x3F5;RI activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>), leading to an overall positive regulatory role in Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling. The overall role of NTAL in Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling is less clear, with different studies indicating either positive or negative regulatory roles based on mouse gene knock-out and human RNAi knockdown studies in which the entire NTAL protein was deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). Two recent studies have focused on a positive regulatory role for NTAL in linking Fc&#x3F5;RI activation to PLC&#x3B3; activation through pathways that are parallel to and independent of LAT-mediated PLC&#x3B3; activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). One study demonstrated that the adaptor protein Grb2 is recruited to phosphorylated NTAL. The subsequent phosphorylation of Grb2 triggers the recruitment and activation of PLC&#x3B3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). The other study showed that a Gads- and SLP76-mediated pathway that is coupled to NTAL links Fc&#x3F5;RI activation to PLC&#x3B3; activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). Aside from LAT and NTAL, a number of additional adaptor proteins that play a role in Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling, many of which associate with LAT and NTAL to form large scaffolding complexes (<italic>e.g.</italic> Grb2, Gads, and SLP76), have been extensively discussed by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>).</p>

    <sec>
      <title>Lipid Signaling Downstream of Fc&#x3F5;RI</title>
      <p>Several lipid signaling pathways are activated downstream of Fc&#x3F5;RI via Fyn, including pathways mediated by PI3K, SphK, and PLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). The PI3K enzymes catalyze the phosphorylation of the inositol ring of membrane-associated phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) at the D3 position to generate phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>), a major intracellular lipid mediator that has effects on multiple signaling pathways involved in degranulation and cytokine production.</p>
      <p>The PI3K enzyme family consists of three subclasses, of which the class I PI3Ks are the most well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). The class I PI3Ks are further subdivided into class IA and class IB PI3Ks. The class IA PI3Ks consist of a p85 regulatory subunit and a p110 catalytic subunit; there are five isoforms of p85 and three isoforms of p110. The class IB PI3Ks consist of a p101 or p87<sup>PIKAP</sup> regulatory subunit and a p110 catalytic &#x3B3;-subunit. The p110 &#x3B1;- and &#x3B2;-isoforms are ubiquitously expressed, and the p110 &#x3B4;- and &#x3B3;-isoforms (p110&#x3B4; and p110&#x3B3;, respectively) are expressed mainly in leukocytes. Both p110&#x3B4; and p110&#x3B3; contribute to Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling in mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). p110&#x3B4; is directly activated downstream of Fc&#x3F5;RI, and genetic and pharmacologic inactivation of p110&#x3B4; leads to reduced mast cell degranulation, eicosanoid production, and cytokine production both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>). The role of p110&#x3B3; in Fc&#x3F5;RI-induced mast cell activation is more controversial. p110&#x3B3; is activated by G-protein-coupled receptors. As such, it is indirectly activated downstream of Fc&#x3F5;RI via autocrine mast cell signals that are mediated by adenosine and other G-protein-coupled receptor agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> stimulation of mast cells from p110&#x3B3; knock-out mice results in reduced degranulation compared with mast cells from wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>). However, whereas one study reported reduced <italic>in vivo</italic> activation of mast cells in p110&#x3B3; knock-out mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>), another study reported a lack of effect of p110&#x3B3; knock-out or pharmacologic inactivation of p110&#x3B3; on <italic>in vivo</italic> mast cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>).</p>
      <p>PIP<sub>3</sub> that is generated by PI3K enzymes recruits several signaling proteins to the cell membrane via interaction with pleckstrin homology domains in these proteins, thereby propagating intracellular signaling. These signaling effectors include PDK1, which activates Akt to promote cell proliferation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>), and Btk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>), which activates PLC&#x3B3;. PIP<sub>3</sub> also has regulatory effects on PLD and SphK. PI3K is positively regulated by RasGRP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>), in addition to being activated by Fyn. Mast cells from RasGRP1 knock-out mice show defects in multiple pathways downstream of PIP<sub>3</sub>, including reduced phosphorylation of Akt. This results in reduced degranulation and cytokine production upon Fc&#x3F5;RI activation of RasGRP1 knock-out mast cells.</p>
      <p>SphKs generate sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) from sphingosine. There are two SphK isoforms, but the contribution of each SphK isoform to Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling and mast cell activation is controversial. One group has defined an intracellular pathway whereby SphK2 generates S1P, which subsequently promotes intracellular calcium signaling that results in mast cell degranulation and cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>). SphK1 in other cell types generates S1P that is released extracellularly and acts on mast cells via the S1P1 and S1P2 receptors to promote mast cell migration and to enhance mast cell degranulation and cytokine production upon Fc&#x3F5;RI activation. On the other hand, data from other groups indicate that SphK1, as opposed to SphK2, is the major intracellular source of S1P in mast cells downstream of Fc&#x3F5;RI activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>). These groups have also described roles for extracellular S1P in mast cell migration and Fc&#x3F5;RI activation via the S1P1 and S1P2 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>).</p>

      <title>Calcium Signaling Downstream of Fc&#x3F5;RI</title>
      <p>Intracellular calcium signaling contributes to degranulation, eicosanoid production, and cytokine production downstream of Fc&#x3F5;RI activation. Fc&#x3F5;RI-induced calcium signaling in mast cells occurs in two steps, the first being release of calcium from intracellular calcium stores in the ER and the second being calcium influx from the extracellular space through store-operated calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>). Intracellular calcium signaling is regulated by PLC&#x3B3;, which generates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol from PIP<sub>2</sub>. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate stimulates the release of intracellular calcium stores upon binding to its receptor in the ER. The depletion of ER calcium stores then triggers extracellular calcium influx. Diacylglycerol and intracellular calcium signals cooperate to activate PKCs, which then activate other pathways such as the NF-&#x3BA;B pathway, ultimately leading to mast cell degranulation and cytokine production.</p>
      <p>Our understanding of intracellular calcium signaling has advanced significantly in recent years due to the discovery of the identity of key components and regulators of store-operated calcium channels. STIM1 (<underline>st</underline>romal <underline>i</underline>nteraction <underline>m</underline>olecule <underline>1</underline>) was identified as a calcium sensor located in the ER that couples the depletion of intracellular ER calcium stores to the activation of store-operated calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>). Orai1/CRACM1 is a recently discovered membrane protein that constitutes the store-operated calcium channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>). Mutation of Orai1 in humans results in severe combined immunodeficiency that is due to a lack of store-operated calcium channel function. Both STIM1 and Orai1 knock-out mast cells are deficient in intracellular calcium signaling downstream of Fc&#x3F5;RI activation due to defective influx of calcium from the extracellular space, leading to defective mast cell degranulation, eicosanoid production, and cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>). Recent data indicate that Syk is a local sensor of calcium signaling that contributes to a positive feedback loop downstream of store-operated calcium channel opening and that also couples extracellular calcium influx to the activation of PKC and other pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>).</p>

      <title>Negative Regulators of Fc&#x3F5;RI Signaling</title>
      <p>Negative regulators of Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling can be grouped into intracellular and cell surface proteins that act at various points in the Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Intracellular negative regulators of Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling include the SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases, which inhibit the activity of signaling proteins that are proximal to Fc&#x3F5;RI such as Syk and Fyn and adaptor proteins such as LAT and NTAL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>). Protein-tyrosine phosphatase &#x3F5; is a phosphatase that also acts at a proximal point in the Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling network by inhibiting Syk activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>). The PI3K pathway is negatively regulated by SHIP and PTEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>), which directly dephosphorylate PIP<sub>3</sub> to generate PIP<sub>2</sub>. SHIP dephosphorylates the phosphate at the D5 position of the inositol ring of PIP<sub>3</sub>, whereas PTEN dephosphorylates the phosphate at the D3 position. The PI3K pathway is also negatively regulated by RGS13 and LAX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>), which inhibit the interaction of the PI3K p85 regulatory subunit with the Grb2-NTAL scaffolding complex. Mast cells that are deficient in these negative regulators have heightened degranulation and/or cytokine responses downstream of Fc&#x3F5;RI activation. Cell surface proteins on mast cells that negatively regulate Fc&#x3F5;RI activation include TRPM4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>), which modulates extracellular calcium influx, and TLR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>), which, upon association with the ES62 product of filarial nematodes, traffics into vesicular compartments, where it sequesters and degrades PKC&#x3B1;, a protein kinase that mediates PLD and SphK activation downstream of Fc&#x3F5;RI.</p>

PI3K signaling is negatively regulated by SHIP, PTEN, LAX, and RGS13. Ras signaling is negatively regulated by RasGAP. Cell surface proteins that negatively regulate Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling include TRPM4, which reduces calcium signaling, and TLR4, which, upon formation of a complex with the ES62 product of filarial nematodes, inhibits SphK and PLD signaling by sequestering and degrading SphK- and PLD-activating PKC&#x3B1;. Co-cross-linking of the ITIM-containing cell surface receptor Fc&#x3B3;RIIb with Fc&#x3F5;RI triggers the inhibition of Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling at several points, including SHIP-mediated inactivation of PI3K signaling and DOK1/RasGAP-mediated inactivation of Ras signaling. Co-cross-linking of Fc&#x3F5;RI with other ITIM-containing cell surface receptors triggers the inhibition of Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling mediated by SHP-1 and SHP-2. <italic>DAG</italic>, diacylglycerol; <italic>IP3</italic>, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate.</p>

      <p>A number of cell surface receptors that contain cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs) are found in mast cells and function to negatively regulate Fc&#x3F5;RI activation upon co-engagement with Fc&#x3F5;RI by engaging endogenous negative regulatory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>). These ITIM-containing receptors include Fc&#x3B3;RIIb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>), PIR-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">89</xref>), gp49B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>), myeloid-associated immunoglobulin receptor I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>), mast cell function-associated antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">92</xref>), signal regulator protein &#x3B1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">93</xref>), and the recently identified Allergin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">94</xref>). The mechanisms of Fc&#x3B3;RIIb-mediated inhibition of Fc&#x3F5;RI activation have been extensively described. Co-engagement of Fc&#x3B3;RIIb with Fc&#x3F5;RI results in Lyn-mediated phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue in the Fc&#x3B3;RIIb ITIM motif, which subsequently recruits the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHIP and the docking protein DOK1 to the Fc&#x3F5;RI complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>). SHIP is activated by phosphorylation and mediates dephosphorylation of PIP<sub>3</sub> to generate PIP<sub>2</sub>, thereby directly inhibiting the PI3K pathway. DOK1 recruits and activates Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP), which inhibits the Ras pathway by enhancing the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras. All other ITIM-containing cell surface receptors inhibit Fc&#x3F5;RI activation through the action of SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases.</p>

      <title>Therapeutic Targeting of Fc&#x3F5;RI Signaling</title>
      <p>Given the clinical efficacy of therapeutic anti-IgE neutralization in asthma, which reduces Fc&#x3F5;RI activation and has revealed an important role for Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling in asthma pathogenesis, future therapies that directly target and inhibit Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling have significant potential for the treatment of asthma, especially those therapeutic strategies that lead to a more complete and/or faster inhibition of Fc&#x3F5;RI activation compared with anti-IgE therapy. Several intracellular proteins that play key roles in Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling and mast cell activation and whose therapeutic inhibition may lead to superior efficacy compared with anti-IgE therapy have been discussed in this minireview. Of these, there are significant ongoing efforts to generate small molecule inhibitors of Syk and PI3K, which have resulted in some compounds that have entered human clinical trials for asthma or other allergic diseases. There has also been recent progress in the generation of specific small molecule inhibitors of Btk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">95</xref>). The discovery of STIM1 and Orai1 has spurred efforts to identify novel small molecule inhibitors of these components and regulators of store-operated calcium channels. A major concern associated with many of these small molecule targets is their broad biology beyond Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling, which may result in adverse safety profiles upon therapeutic targeting.</p>
      <p>An alternative approach to the intracellular small molecule targeting of Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling utilizes protein-based therapeutics, which are well suited for specifically targeting cell surface proteins. Several groups have developed protein-based therapeutics that directly inhibit Fc&#x3F5;RI activation by co-cross-linking Fc&#x3F5;RI with various cell surface ITIM-containing receptors, most commonly Fc&#x3B3;RIIb. These approaches include an IgE-Fc/IgG-Fc fusion protein that simultaneously engages Fc&#x3F5;RI and Fc&#x3B3;RIIb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">96</xref>), a specific allergen/IgG-Fc fusion protein that simultaneously engages allergen-specific IgE that is bound to Fc&#x3F5;RI and Fc&#x3B3;RIIb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>), and various bispecific antibody technologies that co-cross-link Fc&#x3F5;RI with Fc&#x3B3;RIIb or other ITIM-containing receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">99</xref>). Limitations of several of these protein-based therapeutics include poor <italic>in vivo</italic> pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and difficulties associated with large-scale manufacturing, although some new bispecific antibody formats can overcome many of these limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">99</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100">100</xref>). Given the increasing development and use of antibody therapeutics for the treatment of diseases, including asthma, novel bispecific antibody approaches may help expand the scope of therapeutic targets in the future.</p>

      <title>Summary</title>
      <p>A substantial network of signaling molecules and adaptor proteins that function downstream of Fc&#x3F5;RI activation has been defined. Future studies will continue to elucidate the cell and membrane biology of Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling, novel cell surface and intracellular mediators of Fc&#x3F5;RI activation, mechanisms of intracellular calcium signaling, and new inhibitory proteins that negatively regulate parts of the signaling network downstream of Fc&#x3F5;RI activation. Our increasing understanding of Fc&#x3F5;RI signaling may lead to the development of new therapeutics that inhibit Fc&#x3F5;RI activation for the treatment of asthma.</p>
