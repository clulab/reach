We have performed a systematic characterization of the 17 human DENN domain proteins and demonstrated that they are specific GEFs for 10 Rabs. DENND1A/1B localize to clathrin patches at the plasma membrane and activate Rab35 in an endocytic pathway trafficking Shiga toxin to the trans-Golgi network. DENND2 GEFs target to actin filaments and control Rab9-dependent trafficking of mannose-6-phosphate receptor to lysosomes. DENND4 GEFs target to a tubular membrane compartment adjacent to the Golgi, where they activate Rab10, which suggests a function in basolateral polarized sorting in epithelial cells that compliments the non-DENN GEF Sec2 acting on Rab8 in apical sorting. DENND1C, DENND3, DENND5A/5B, MTMR5/13, and MADD activate Rab13, Rab12, Rab39, Rab28, and Rab27A/27B, respectively.

Rabs are activated by specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) promoting the release of GDP and binding of GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pfeffer and Aivazian, 2004</xref>). According to the prevailing model, GEFs together with other regulatory factors localize to and act at specific membrane surfaces, and thus provide a means to locally activate their target Rabs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pfeffer and Aivazian, 2004</xref>). This system allows vesicles derived from a particular organelle to be tagged with a specific Rab GTPase, and their movement along the cytoskeleton and tethering to a specified domain on a target membrane to be controlled. Effector protein complexes that are either activated or recruited to the membrane surface by the presence of the GTP-bound Rab mediate these cytoskeletal and membrane tethering functions. GTP hydrolysis triggered either by additional GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) or spontaneously because of intrinsic activity of the Rab ends the cycle. GEFs and GAPs therefore play a key role in the specific activation and inactivation of Rab GTPases.</p><p>The known Rab GEFs and GAPs typically fall into discrete families defined by conserved protein domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barr and Lambright, 2010</xref>). With the exception of the Rab3GAP1/2 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fukui et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nagano et al., 1998</xref>), Rab GAPs characteristically contain a TBC domain that catalyzes nucleotide hydrolysis by an arginine-glutamine two-finger mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pan et al., 2006</xref>). In humans, the TBC domain family has over 40 members, and it is likely that these regulate all 63 human Rabs, with some TBC domain proteins acting on several closely related Rabs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haas et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fuchs et al., 2007</xref>). Rab GEFs are more diverse, and several conserved, yet structurally unrelated proteins and protein complexes have been shown to have specific Rab GEF activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barr and Lambright, 2010</xref>). These are: the TRAPP-I complex activating Ypt1p/Rab1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2008</xref>), Vps9 domain proteins activating Rab5/Ypt51p subfamily GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delprato et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sato et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delprato and Lambright, 2007</xref>), Sec2p/Rabin proteins activating Sec4p GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Walch-Solimena et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hattula et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Itzen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sato et al., 2007b</xref>), the Ric1p&#x02013;Rgp1p complex activating Ypt6p and possibly Rab6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Siniossoglou et al., 2000</xref>), the Mon1p&#x02013;Ccz1p complex acting on Ypt7p and Rab7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nordmann et al., 2010</xref>), and the RCC1 domain protein claret, which may act as a GEF for the unique Rab lightoid in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2004</xref>). Apart from claret, these GEFs and their target Rab GTPases act in trafficking pathways conserved from mammals to yeasts. However, mammalian cells possess &#x0003e;60 Rabs, compared with the 11 of budding yeast, and therefore require additional GEFs to activate these extra Rabs. At present, most of the 60 mammalian Rabs lack a defined GEF activity, and it is therefore unclear how they would be specifically activated. Additional Rab GEFs are therefore likely to exist.</p><p>DENN domain proteins were first implicated as Rab GEFs by the biochemical purification of a Rab3 GEF from bovine brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wada et al., 1997</xref>). This was subsequently identified as a DENN domain protein, although it remained unclear which domain in the protein was responsible for GEF activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coppola et al., 2002</xref>). Further studies revealed that the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> MADD homologue AEX-3 was responsible for controlling the activity of Rab3 and Rab27 at the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iwasaki et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mahoney et al., 2006</xref>). More recently, a screen for defective receptor-mediated yolk protein endocytosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> identified another DENN domain protein RME-4, and indicated that it acted on Rab35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sato et al., 2008</xref>). This was confirmed by complementary studies in mammalian cells showing that the RME-4 homologue DENND1A/connecdenn was in fact a Rab35 GEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allaire et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marat and McPherson, 2010</xref>). These findings support the idea that DENN domain proteins might form a family of Rab GEFs. To investigate this, we have characterized the human DENN domain proteins, and identified their target or substrate Rab GTPases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of human DENN domain proteins</title><p>Sequence searches of the human genome using the DENN domain of the Rab3 GEF MADD reveal the presence of 17 proteins sharing this domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). All these proteins carry a full DENN domain comprising the three upstream (u-DENN), core (DENN), and downstream (d-DENN) subregions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Levivier et al., 2001</xref>). Systematic searching of the genome sequence databases reveals that although widely conserved in metazoans and protozoans, these DENN domain proteins are absent from the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> used as a model for trafficking studies. This suggests that DENN domain proteins may act as GEFs for some of the many additional Rabs found in humans and other metazoans. Further analysis indicates that in addition to these proteins, there is a group of related proteins containing partial DENN homology. Some of these such as Avl9 and its homologues are conserved to budding yeast and other fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harsay and Schekman, 2007</xref>). Because Avl9 may be a GEF for the non-Rab Ras family GTPase Gtr2 in late Golgi trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harsay and Schekman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), these are unlikely to be Rab GEFs and they were not pursued further in this study.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DENN proteins form a large family in human cells.</bold> A schematic showing the human DENN domain proteins, with the upstream (u-DENN), core DENN, and downstream (d-DENN) regions indicated.

The Vps9 domain GEF Rabex-5 was used for this purpose. As expected, Rabex-5 promoted GDP release from Rab5A-C, and displayed some activity toward the Rab5 subfamily GTPases Rab17, Rab21, and Rab22A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Other Rabs fell below the background value set at twice the median. The short form of DENND1B encoding only a DENN domain was then tested for GEF activity using the GDP-releasing assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). This revealed that DENND1B-S promoted GDP release from Rab35 but not the other Rabs tested. For true GEF activities, GTP binding rapidly follows GDP release, and it was therefore important to test this. DENND1B-S specifically promoted GTP binding to Rab35 but not the other Rabs tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Similar results were obtained for DENND1A and the long form of DENND1B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). DENND1C in contrast was most active toward Rab13 and showed no activity to Rab35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Together, these findings show that DENND1A and DENND1B are Rab35-specific GEFs, and that this activity is caused by the DENN domain.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DENND1A/1B are GEFs for Rab35.</bold> (A) Human Rabex-5 was tested against a representative panel of human Rab proteins using the GDP-releasing assay. In brief, 10 &#x000b5;g of each GST-tagged Rab to be tested was incubated in 50 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 6.8, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 125 &#x000b5;M EDTA, 10 &#x000b5;M Mg-GDP, and 5 &#x000b5;Ci [<sup>3</sup>H]-GDP (10 mCi/ml; 5,000 Ci/mmol) in a total volume of 200 &#x000b5;l for 15 min at 30&#x000b0;C to load the Rab with the radioactive GDP probe. For standard GDP-releasing GEF assays, 100 &#x000b5;l of the loading reaction was then mixed with 10 &#x000b5;l of 10 mM Mg-GTP and 10 nM His<sub>6</sub>-tagged Rabex-5 purified from bacteria or a buffer control, then adjusted to 120 &#x000b5;l final volume with assay buffer. The GEF reaction occurred for 20 min at 30&#x000b0;C. After this, 2.5 &#x000b5;l was taken for a specific activity measurement; the remainder was split into two tubes, then incubated with 500 &#x000b5;l of ice-cold assay buffer containing 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 20 &#x000b5;l of packed glutathione-sepharose for 60 min at 4&#x000b0;C to separate Rab&#x02013;GDP complexes from free &#x0201c;released&#x0201d; GDP. After washing three times with 500 &#x000b5;l of ice-cold assay buffer, the sepharose was transferred to a vial containing 4 ml of scintillation fluid and counted. The amount of nucleotide exchange was calculated in pmoles of GDP released. (B and C) A representative panel of human Rab proteins was tested against 10 nM of His<sub>6</sub>-tagged DENND1B-S in the GDP-releasing (B) or GTP-binding assay (C). For GTP-binding assays, the following modifications were made: only unlabeled GDP was used in the loading reaction; in the GEF reaction, 0.5 &#x000b5;l of 10 mM GTP and 1 &#x000b5;Ci [<sup>35</sup>S]-GTP&#x003b3;S (10 mCi/ml; 5000 Ci/mmol) were used. The amount of nucleotide exchange was calculated in pmoles of GTP bound. (D and E) Human DENND1A (D), DENND1B-L (D), and DENND1C (E) were tested against a subset of Rab35-related Rabs using the GTP-binding assay. For these assays, 10 nM of FLAG-tagged DENND1A or DENND1C purified from HeLa cells, or 10 nM of His<sub>6</sub>-tagged DENND1B-L purified from bacteria were used.

If DENND1A and DENND1B are specific GEFs for Rab35, then they might be expected to localize to a membrane compartment of this trafficking pathway. DENND1A localization was therefore examined in HeLa cells, where it was found to target to small punctate structures overlapping with clathrin and the plasma membrane AP-2 clathrin adaptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). The AP-1 and AP-3 clathrin adaptors associated with other trafficking steps did not overlap with DENND1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Analysis of DENND1A complex using mass spectrometry showed that they contained clathrin and components of the AP-2 complex but not other clathrin adaptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Western blotting confirmed that DENND1A specifically interacts with clathrin and the AP-2 complex but not other adaptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). The other DENND1 family members DENND1B and DENND1C did not interact with clathrin or clathrin adaptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>). Depletion of clathrin caused loss of the punctate DENND1A plasma membrane staining and overlapping with AP-2, and resulted in a diffuse cytoplasmic and reticular pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). DENND1A therefore targets to clathrin and the AP-2&#x02013;positive patches at the plasma membrane, which supports the idea that it functions in some form of endocytic trafficking. To test this idea, HeLa cells were depleted of DENND1A, DENND1B, and clathrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>), then tested for receptor-mediated uptake of the growth factor EGF or the transport of Shiga toxin B subunit (STxB) to the trans-Golgi network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, B and C</xref>). Cells depleted of DENND1A failed to transport STxB to the trans-Golgi network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, B and D</xref>). In the same cells, the uptake of EGF into punctate endosomal structures was not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Depletion of clathrin strongly reduced EGF uptake and caused the transferrin receptor to accumulate at the cell surface rather than showing its normal punctate recycling endosome distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Although clathrin depletion did not block STxB uptake, uptake efficiency was reduced and it failed to overlap with the trans-Golgi network marker TGN46 after 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, C and D</xref>). Together, these findings support the idea that DENND1A is a Rab35 GEF regulating an endocytic trafficking pathway used by the Shiga toxin to reach the trans-Golgi network, but that DENND1A is not essential for the receptor-mediated uptake of EGF.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Localization of DENND1A is clathrin dependent.</bold> (A) HeLa cells expressing EGFP-tagged DENND1A (green) were fixed and then stained with antibodies to clathrin heavy chain, and the AP-1, AP-2, and AP-3 clathrin adaptor complexes (red).

The DENND2 family has four members, and one of these, DENND2D, comprises only a DENN domain. This was tested first. DENND2D displayed specific GDP-releasing activity to both Rab9A and Rab9B but not any other Rab tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>), which supports the view that the DENN domain alone is responsible for GEF activity. This specificity was confirmed for the three other DENND2 family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Examination of DENND2 family localization revealed that DENND2A and DENND2B were present on filaments reminiscent of actin, that DENND2C overexpression caused cell shape changes and formed large patches in cell protrusions, and that DENND2D was diffusely located throughout the entire cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs. 5 C</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201008051/DC1">S1</ext-link>). The pronounced actin filament localization of DENND2A was especially intriguing because it was recently shown that the Rho family protein RhoBTB3 is a Rab9 effector protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Espinosa et al., 2009</xref>). Rho family proteins are typically associated with processes controlling the actin cytoskeleton, and this suggests there may be a link between Rab9 function and the actin cytoskeleton. As expected, Rab9 was present on LAMP1-positive lysosomes defined by the marker LAMP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>). Depletion of Rab9 or DENND2A resulted in a similar phenotype, where lysosomes clustered adjacent to the perinuclear region and were lost from the more peripheral regions of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Depletion of other DENND2 family members had no obvious effect in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref> and not depicted). Rab9 has a well-documented function in trafficking of the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (MPR) between the TGN and late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lombardi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">D&#x000ed;az et al., 1997</xref>), and this function was therefore investigated. Cells depleted of Rab9 or DENND2A showed reduced intensity of MPR staining relative to control cells and a loss of MPR-positive structures in the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>). Fluorescence intensity measurements either integrating the total cell associated signal or taking a transection through the perinuclear region indicate that there is a &#x0003e;60% reduction in MPR staining intensity in DENND2A- and Rab9-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>). Blocking Rab9 function prevents recycling of MPR from late endosomes back to the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Riederer et al., 1994</xref>); thus, the MPR may become trapped in late endosomes and may enter the lysosomes, where it will be degraded. Other TGN recycling pathways were not obviously perturbed by Rab9 or DENND2A depletion because the TGN marker TGN46 was not changed by these treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>). Consistent with the biochemical GEF assay data, loss of Rab9 activity either by depleting Rab9 or its GEF regulator DENND2A causes a similar phenotype. These findings support the idea that the DENND2 family members act as GEFs for Rab9 in trafficking between the late endosomes and the TGN. Interestingly, components of the BLOC complex involved in trafficking to lysosome-like organelles have been found to associate with actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Falc&#x000f3;n-P&#x000e9;rez et al., 2002</xref>) and to interact with Rab9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kloer et al., 2010</xref>). The diversity of DENND2 family members suggests that this pathway is regulated differently in different tissues, possibly linking Rab9 regulation at late endosomes and lysosome-related organelles to the status of the actin cytoskeleton.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>The DENND2 family regulates Rab9 and lysosomes.</bold> (A) A representative panel of human Rab proteins was tested against 10 nM of His<sub>6</sub>-tagged human DENND2D purified from bacteria using the GDP-releasing assay.

Questions remain, however, about how these two GTPases are independently regulated. Two GEFs carrying the Sec2 domain have been reported to show activity toward Rab8, but the GEF for Rab10 is unknown. Analysis of the DENND4 family proteins showed that these specifically promote GDP release from and GTP binding to Rab10 and have no activity toward Rab8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, A and B</xref>). In contrast, Sec2 domain proteins Rabin3/Rabin8 and Rabin3-like/GRAB are specific GEFs for Rab8A and Rab8B and have no activity toward Rab10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, C and D</xref>). Thus, the Sec2 domain proteins Rabin8 and GRAB, and the DENN domain proteins of the DENND4 family could provide a means to activate Rab8 and Rab10, respectively, and thus independently control polarized trafficking. Although DENND4A and DENND4C showed a diffuse cytoplasmic localization in HeLa cells, DENND4B was present on a tubular membrane compartment emanating from the perinuclear region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 E</xref> and S1). Strikingly, DENND4B staining is coincident with that of its target Rab10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 E</xref>).

DENN proteins are conserved in primitive unicellular eukaryotes such as protozoans of the <italic>Naegleria</italic> genus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fritz-Laylin et al., 2010</xref>), fission yeast, filamentous fungi, and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Levivier et al., 2001</xref>); however, they are absent from budding yeast. Consistent with this, none of the DENN target Rabs identified by this study are present in budding yeast. As reported previously, MADD acts on Rab27A, which functions in melanosome transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Figueiredo et al., 2008</xref>). DENND1 and the <italic>C. elegans</italic> equivalent RME-4 act on Rab35 in endocytic trafficking pathways absent from budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sato et al., 2008</xref>). Previous investigation of the DENND1/connecdenn proteins in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allaire et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marat and McPherson, 2010</xref>) has shown that Rab35 and DENND1A/connecdenn 1 play a role in recycling of MHC class I at an early endosomal compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allaire et al., 2010</xref>). These authors have also shown that connecdenn proteins interact with clathrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allaire et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marat and McPherson, 2010</xref>), and our findings confirm this for DENND1A/connecdenn 1. We find that clathrin is required for Shiga toxin delivery to the TGN, but not its endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). This fits with the idea that the STxB traffics through an early endosomal sorting compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fuchs et al., 2007</xref>), where it undergoes a clathrin-dependent sorting event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Popoff et al., 2007</xref>), before delivery to the TGN. DENND3 and DENND1C, like their targets Rab12 and Rab13, respectively, are present in vertebrates but are absent in invertebrates. In mammalian polarized epithelial cells, Rab13 functions in trafficking between recycling endosomes and the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nokes et al., 2008</xref>). Together with the data presented here, this suggests that the DENND1 family controls endosomal recycling and endosome&#x02013;TGN trafficking routes involving Rab13 and Rab35.</p><p>Putative orthologues of DENND5A/Rab6-interacting protein 1 and its target Rab39 exist in worms, flies, and vertebrates. Interestingly, Rab39 is localized to the Golgi apparatus like its regulators DENND5A/B, and loss-of-function mutations in Rab39B cause X-linked mental retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giannandrea et al., 2010</xref>). The underlying defect appears to be caused by altered trafficking required for growth cone and synapse formation, which suggests that further studies of DENND5 should focus on neuronal systems rather than fibroblast-like tissue culture cells. A homologue of the Myotubularin phosphatase domain containing DENN proteins MTMR5 and MTMR13, and their target Rab28, is present in protozoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fritz-Laylin et al., 2010</xref>), which suggests this has a trafficking function conserved at the cellular level rather than in a tissue-specific pathway. Contradicting this view somewhat, mutations in human MTMR13 and disruption of MMR13 in mice result in an autosomal recessive neuropathy, which suggests a function important for nervous system function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azzedine et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Robinson et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, DENND4 family GEFs and Rab10 are also always found together in multicellular organisms with polarized epithelial cell layers.</p><p>Rabs of the Rab8 and Rab10 families have been implicated in trafficking to polarized membrane domains at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babbey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schuck et al., 2007</xref>). In budding yeast Sec4p, the Rab8 homologue is required for polarized transport from the late-Golgi into the growing bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Walch-Solimena et al., 1997</xref>). In higher eukaryotes, Rab8 has been found to function in transport to actin-rich membrane protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Per&#x000e4;nen et al., 1996</xref>), the cilium, and apical surface of polarized epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nachury et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sato et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yoshimura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kn&#x000f6;dler et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, Rab10 is reported to function in basolateral transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babbey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schuck et al., 2007</xref>). It seems obvious that Rab8 and Rab10 would require activation by specific GEFs, and this appears to be the case. Sec4p and Rab8 are activated by Sec2 domain GEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Walch-Solimena et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hattula et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Itzen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sato et al., 2007b</xref>), whereas DENND4 family GEFs activate Rab10. This is supported by observations that mutations in CRAG, the presumed <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue of human DENND4, result in missorting of cargo such as perlecan and laminin destined for the basolateral surface of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denef et al., 2008</xref>). However, the fruit fly poses a problem for this simple idea because it lacks a documented gene encoding a Sec2 domain protein. At present, it is only possible to speculate how Rab8 is activated in fruit flies, but the two most likely possibilities are either that there is a novel Rab8 GEF or that a known GEF family has acquired activity toward Rab8. DENND2 specificity raises similar issues because Rab9 is present in flies, although a readily discernable DENND2 is not. Flies may have some unique features with regard to Rab regulation, and further studies will be necessary to address these issues. Interestingly, DENND2B, also known as suppressor of tumorigenicity 5 (ST5), is mutated in human patients suffering from mental retardation and multiple congenital abnormalities that can result in deafness, cleft palate, and circulatory and kidney function defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">G&#x000f6;hring et al., 2010</xref>). Our results suggest that these defects may be caused by defective regulation of Rab9, and hence trafficking between late endosomes and lysosomes. This is reminiscent of lysosomal storage disorders, which are long known to cause mental retardation and other developmental abnormalities.</p><p>There appear to be no obvious characteristics distinguishing DENN-modulated Rabs from those controlled by other classes of GEFs and Rabs with as yet unknown GEFs. In a sequence alignment partitioned into these three groups there were no positions that clearly differentiated Rabs under DENN regulation from others (unpublished data). Furthermore, when sequence conservation among DENN-modulated Rabs was mapped onto the surface of the structure of one of them, no additional conserved surface patches&#x02014;putative DENN-interaction sites&#x02014;were observed when a comparison was made to Rabs not under DENN control (unpublished data). This suggests that DENNs bind to sites that overlap those seen for other GEFs, perhaps because of shared functional necessities such as switch I displacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barr and Lambright, 2010</xref>). This and an apparent lack of signature features of DENN-modulated Rabs suggest that only small changes and/or changes at different positions may have been responsible for altering GEF class specificity during Rab evolution. This conclusion is supported by the close relationships between Rabs that are regulated by unrelated GEF classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Are DENN-related proteins Rab GEFs?</title><p>As shown here and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allaire et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marat and McPherson, 2010</xref>), DENN domain proteins are specific Rab GEFs. It is interesting to note that some of the DENN-related proteins are found throughout the eukaryotic kingdom and are therefore likely to function in conserved cellular processes, including membrane trafficking events. This suggests that the DENN-related proteins might also have Rab GEF activity. However, the only characterized member of this family, budding yeast Avl9p, is possibly a regulator of Gtr2p, a Ras superfamily GTPase outside the Rab subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harsay and Schekman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Our preliminary evidence also indicates that human Avl9 does not act on any of the human Rabs. Although this supports the idea that DENN and DENN-related domains specify GEF activity toward GTPases of the Ras superfamily, these findings suggest they may not all be Rab GEFs. Further studies will be needed to investigate their specificity and define the cellular processes they act in.</p></sec><sec><title>Many conserved Rabs lack GEF regulators</title><p>Despite the advances presented here in assigning the specificity of 17 Rab GEFs, several key Rabs involved in membrane trafficking, lipid droplet, and cilium formation are still left without GEF activators. It is intriguing that these often cluster into related groups. For example, see Rab2/4/14 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>, which may indicate that these share a family of related but as yet unknown regulators. Here, we argued that because Rabs form a large closely related family, their regulators might do the same and share a common domain. This led us to more closely investigate the DENN domain proteins. Following this line of argument, it may therefore be worthwhile to test conserved domains widely associated with proteins functioning in trafficking for GEF activity. This might include the DENN-related proteins, although there are caveats as discussed, the SNX and BAR domain families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Weering et al., 2010</xref>), and RCC1 domain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2004</xref>). However, it is possible that common domains do not unite the remaining Rab GEFs, and thus other unbiased biochemical and genetic strategies will need to be followed if they are to be identified. Although the work presented here will be useful in informing many future studies on membrane trafficking, we are still some way from defining the full complement of Rab GEF and GAP regulators and effector proteins necessary for a full understanding of Rab function.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>General laboratory chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and Thermo Fisher Scientific.

After 5 min at room temperature, 100 &#x000b5;l of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was added to stop the reaction. Excess dye was removed by desalting over PD10 columns (GE Healthcare). Fractions of 500 &#x000b5;l were collected, and absorption was measured at 280 and 552 nm. Using molar extinction coefficients of 150,000 M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for Cy3 and 170,000 M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for pentameric STxB, dye labeling was calculated as 1 Cy3 per toxin subunit with a concentration of 0.7 mg/ml.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture and protein purification from mammalian cells</title><p>HeLa and HEK293 cells were cultured in DME containing 10% bovine calf serum (Invitrogen) at 37&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. For plasmid transfection and siRNA transfection, Mirus LT1 (Mirus Bio LLC), and Oligofectamine (Invitrogen), respectively, were used according to the manufacturers&#x02019; instructions. FLAG-tagged forms of DENND1A, DENND1C, DENND3, DENND4A, DENND4B, DENND4C, DENND5A, DENND5B, MTMR5, MTMR13, and MADD in pcDNA5/FRT/TO were transiently expressed in 10 &#x000d7; 15-cm dishes of 70% confluent HeLa cells. After 48 h of growth, the cell pellet was lysed for 20 min on ice in 5 ml of cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors cocktails). Cell lysates were split into 1.0 ml aliquots and clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 <italic>g</italic> in a microcentrifuge (5417R Microfuge; Eppendorf) for 20 min. The FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from the clarified lysate using 100 &#x000b5;l of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 h at 4&#x000b0;C. The pellet was washed 10 times in 1 ml of cell lysis buffer, 10 times in 1 ml of high-salt buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 500 mM NaCl), and 10 times in TBS, and finally the proteins were eluted with 100 &#x000b5;l of 200 &#x000b5;g/ml FLAG-peptide in TBS containing 2 mM dithiothreitol. The eluted proteins were analyzed on 7.5&#x02013;10% SDS-PAGE gels stained with Coomassie brilliant blue, and concentrations were estimated by comparison to a series of BSA standards in the range of 0.1&#x02013;1 mg. The peak fractions were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C without dialysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Nucleotide binding and GEF assays</title><p>Nucleotide loading was performed as follows: 10 &#x000b5;g of GST-tagged Rab was incubated in 50 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 6.8, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 125 &#x000b5;M EDTA, 10 &#x000b5;M Mg-GDP, and 5 &#x000b5;Ci [<sup>3</sup>H]-GDP (10 mCi/ml; 5,000 Ci/mmol) in a total volume of 200 &#x000b5;l for 15 min at 30&#x000b0;C. For standard GDP-releasing GEF assays, 100 &#x000b5;l of the loading reaction was mixed with 10 &#x000b5;l of 10 mM Mg-GTP and 10&#x02013;100 nM GEF protein to be tested or a buffer control, and adjusted to 120 &#x000b5;l final volume with assay buffer. The GEF reaction occurred for 20 min at 30&#x000b0;C. After this, 2.5 &#x000b5;l was taken for a specific activity measurement; the remainder was split into two tubes, then incubated with 500 &#x000b5;l of ice-cold assay buffer containing 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 20 &#x000b5;l of packed glutathione-sepharose for 60 min at 4&#x000b0;C. After washing three times with 500 &#x000b5;l of ice-cold assay buffer, the sepharose was transferred to a vial containing 4 ml of scintillation fluid and counted. The amount of nucleotide exchange was calculated in pmoles of GDP released. For GTP-binding assays the following modifications were made: only unlabeled GDP was used in the loading reaction; in the GEF reaction, 0.5 &#x000b5;l of 10 mM GTP and 1 &#x000b5;Ci [<sup>35</sup>S]-GTP&#x003b3;S (10 mCi/ml; 5,000 Ci/mmol) were used. The amount of nucleotide exchange was calculated in pmoles of GTP bound.</p></sec><sec><title>Microscopy</title><p>Fixed samples on glass slides were imaged using a 60&#x000d7; 1.35 NA oil immersion objective lens on a standard upright microscope equipped with a CoolSNAP HQ2 camera (Roper Industries) under the control of MetaMorph 7.5 software (MDS Analytical Technologies). Images were cropped in Photoshop CS3 (Adobe) or ImageJ and placed into Illustrator CS3 (Adobe) without performing any other contrast adjustments of image manipulations to produce the figures.</p></sec><sec><title>Mass spectrometry</title><p>Protein samples for mass spectrometry were separated on 4&#x02013;12% gradient NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen), then stained using a colloidal Coomassie blue stain. Gel lanes were typically cut into 12 slices, and then digested with trypsin using published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wilm et al., 1996</xref>). The resulting tryptic peptide mixtures in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid were then analyzed by online liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry with a nanoAcquity UPLC (Waters) and Orbitrap XL ETD mass-spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) fitted with a nano-electrospray source (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were loaded on to a 5 cm &#x000d7; 180 &#x000b5;m BEH-C18 Symmetry trap column (part no. 186003514; Waters) in 0.1% formic acid at 15 &#x000b5;l/minute, and then resolved using a 25 cm &#x000d7; 75 &#x000b5;m BEH-C18 column (part no. 186003815; Waters) in 99&#x02013;37.5% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 400 nl/min. The mass spectrometer was set to acquire a mass spectrometry survey scan in the Orbitrap (R = 30,000) and then perform tandem mass spectrometry on the top five ions in the linear quadrupole ion trap after fragmentation using collision ionization (30 ms, 35% energy). A 90-s rolling exclusion list with <italic>n</italic> = 3 was used to prevent redundant analysis of the same ions. Maxquant and Mascot (Matrix Science) were then used to compile and search the raw data against the human International Protein Index database. Protein group and peptide lists were sorted and analyzed in Excel (Microsoft) and Maxquant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>). Mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry spectra were manually inspected using Xcalibur Qualbrowser (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p></sec><sec><title>Bioinformatics</title><p>Sequence alignments of DENNs and Rabs were done with ClustalX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chenna et al., 2003</xref>) or MUSCLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edgar, 2004</xref>), and the results were visualized and manipulated with Jalview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Waterhouse et al., 2009</xref>).
